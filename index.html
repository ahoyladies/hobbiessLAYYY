        <p class="para">My hobby is reading. I spend my free time browsing through ficitonal stories of all my favourite authors. i find great intrests in fantasy realities, so my favourites would definately be the books with magic, things that could never happen in real life. My love of reading began when i was in the second grade (im now in the 6th), my teacher would always read stories to our class. Though, i finally realised what a bibliophile i was in the 3rd grade when my teacher identified how clever i was in this area.
